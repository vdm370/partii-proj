\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

My project tries to tackle one of the most famous problems in the history of Computer science - the Travelling Salesman problem. In that problem, we are given a weighted graph $G = (V, E, w)$, where $V$ denotes the set of vertices, $E$ denotes a set of edges, and $w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R^{+}}$ is a weight function, mapping edges to weight that's assigned to them. We are interesting in finding a minimum-weight cycle in this graph. As we can see, a problem similar to this can arise in many real-world situations (a mailman having to visit a list of houses to deliver the mail, for example), so it is expected that a lot of effort has been put into solving this problem as efficiently as possible. This problem is known to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, basically meaning that there is no polynomial time algorithm solving this problem. With that in mind, we are forced to release some requirements of our algorithm: not demanding that we get a fully correct solution, only sufficiently close to the solution, and/or not demanding to finish in polynomial time, but sufficient fast. This project will try to give a summary of some more or less successful attemps, and analyze what are the advangates and disadvantages of the algorithms involved.

\section{Algorithms}

In this section, I will list all the algorithms that I have taken into consideration for this project. I have made this choice after analyzing already existings benchhmarks about Travelling Salesman problem, trying to find the best tradeoff between complexity, running time, difficulty to reproduce and the result that the algorithm is producing. After having that finished, I have decided to split the algorithms in several classes, listed below:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Exact algorithms}
\item {\bf Approximation algorithms}
\item {\bf Improvement algorithms}
\item {\bf Heuristic algorithms}
\item {\tt Optimization algorithms} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exact algorithms}

{\bf Exact algorithms} are those algorithms which produce the correct solution every time they are run. Knowing the $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness of the TSP, we know that there is no algorithm of this kind running in polynomial time. I have considered 3 algorithms here:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it Brute-force algorithm}
\item {\it Held-Karp (dynamic programming) algorithm}
\item {\it Branch-and-Bound algorithm}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Approximation algorithms}

{\bf Approximation algorithms} are ones that can guarantee some bound concerning the output of the algorithm. For example, the {\it 2-approximation algorithm} guarantees that the cost of the cycle it returned is at most two times larger than the cost of the optimal cycle. They usually run in polynomial time, and all the algorithms I've included in the project do belong in that category.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it 2-approximation algorithm}
\item {\it Christofides-greedy algorithm}
\item {\it Christofides algorithm}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Improvement algorithms}

{\bf Improvement algorithms} are those algorithm which consecutively try to improve an existing solution. Starting with some solution (greedy, for example), they try to alter it in a way that a better solution is produced. Running this algorithm for some time will eventually make the algorithm converge, getting a solution which we take as a final one. In practice, combining improvement techniques with some good strategies for the initial solution produce the best results, and a lot of best solutions on well-known TSP instances are obtained using improvement methods.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it 2-opt algorithm}
\item {\it 3-opt algorithm}
% TODO \item {\it 4-opt algorithm}
\item {\it Lin-Kernighan algorithm}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heuristic algorithms}

{\bf Heuristic algorithms} are algorithms which usually have polynomial running time, usually do not have a guaranteed bound of error, but in general they produce results that are close to the optimal solution. There are a lot of different heuristic for tackling this problem, so I have selected a few that did produce some solid results. Also, these algorithms should not be too hard to code or to understand, in general, and it is surprising how good results can they achieve:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it Random algorithm}
\item {\it Nearest neighbour algorithm (greedy)}
\item {\it Insertion heuristic - cheapest, farthest, nearest, random}
\item {\it Convex-hull heuristic algorithm}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization algorithms}

In {\bf optimization algorithms}, we are starting with random solutions, computing the results those solutions are producing and then adapting towards solutions which are more preferable (have less cost in this example). Running this iteratively, we converge to a solution which can be pretty close to the correct one, no guarantees shown. There are also quite some algorithms which perform the process outlined above, here are some:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\it Ant-colony optimization algorithm}
\item {\it Simulated annealing algorithm}

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Preparation}

In this chapter, I will describe, in full detail, all the algorithms and all the theoretical background needed to start the implementation part of the project, as well as some lemmas and proofs about working performance of the procedures described.

\section{Complexity analysis}

I have already mentioned the fact that the Travelling Salesman Problem can not be solved in polynomial time. Now, we would like to see in which class does this problem belong to. In order to do that, we do not need the fully detailed definitions of them because they are not the main point of this dissertation - so I will give a brief and informal definition of complexity classes we take interest in here:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf $\mathcal{P}$} - the set of all problems which can be correctly solved in polynomial time.
\item {\bf $\mathcal{NP}$} - the set of all problems whose {\it solutions} can be {\it verified} in polynomial time.
\item {\bf $\mathcal{NP}$-hard} - all the problems which can't be solved in polynomial time. This definition is very informal, but it suffices here. % TODO
\item {\bf $\mathcal{NP}$-complete} - problems which are both in $\mathcal{NP}$ and $\mathcal{NP}$-hard.

\end{itemize}

Now, the Travelling Salesman Problem, defined in the introduction is not $\mathcal{NP}$-complete. This might look a bit strange at first glance, but then, we remember that all $\mathcal{NP}$-complete problems are so-called decision problems - problems deciding whether something is true or not.

\smallskip 

It is not hard to see that the TSP does belong in $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, using my previous $\mathcal{NP}$ complexity class definition. Also, for the formal proof, Karp TODO showed in 1972. that the Hamiltonian cycle problem is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete, which implies the $\mathcal{NP}$-hardness of the TSP. But, surprisingly?, it does not belong to $\mathcal{NP}$. In the verification problem, we would be given a graph and one of cycles from that graph, and we are to judge whether that exact cycle is the shortest one. Note that we can not decide that without actually solving the TSP and knowing what the optimal cycle's cost is, so this can not be done in polynomial time knowing the fact we can not solve TSP in that time. So, this definition of the TSP is not in $\mathcal{NP}$, making it not in $\mathcal{NP}$-complete as well.

\smallskip 

The thing that is a bit strange in the above conclusion is the fact that most of the famous `hard' problems are $\mathcal{NP}$-complete as well. But, all those problems are decision problems, unlike our first TSP definition (and pretty much the only sensible definition of this problem). We can artificially make TSP a decision problem, by formulating it as: given a graph and a number, decide whether the cost of the shortest cycle is less than the number. This, rephrased TSP, is indeed in $\mathcal{NP}$-complete - the verification is straightforwardly done in polynomial time.

\medskip

Conclusion to all this is that we definitely need and that it is actaully sensible to use some alternate problem solving algorithms than just the exact one - we need to apply some heuristics.

Verbatim text can be included using \verb|\begin{verbatim}| and
\verb|\end{verbatim}|. I normally use a slightly smaller font and
often squeeze the lines a little closer together, as in:

{\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.8}\small\begin{verbatim}
GET "libhdr"
 
GLOBAL { count:200; all  }
 
LET try(ld, row, rd) BE TEST row=all
                        THEN count := count + 1
                        ELSE { LET poss = all & ~(ld | row | rd)
                               UNTIL poss=0 DO
                               { LET p = poss & -poss
                                 poss := poss - p
                                 try(ld+p << 1, row+p, rd+p >> 1)
                               }
                             }
LET start() = VALOF
{ all := 1
  FOR i = 1 TO 12 DO
  { count := 0
    try(0, 0, 0)
    writef("Number of solutions to %i2-queens is %i5*n", i, count)
    all := 2*all + 1
  }

\section{Adding more complicated graphics}

The use of \LaTeX\ format can be tedious and it is often better to use
encapsulated postscript to represent complicated graphics.
Figure~\ref{epsfig} and ~\ref{xfig} on page \pageref{xfig} are
examples. The second figure was drawn using {\tt xfig} and exported in
{\tt.eps} format. This is my recommended way of drawing all diagrams.


\begin{figure}[tbh]

\section{Printing and binding}

If you have access to a laser printer that can print on two sides, you
can use it to print two copies of your dissertation and then get them
bound by the Computer Laboratory Bookshop. Otherwise, print your
dissertation single sided and get the Bookshop to copy and bind it double
sided.


Better printing quality can sometimes be obtained by giving the
Bookshop an MSDOS 1.44~Mbyte 3.5" floppy disc containing the
Postscript form of your dissertation. If the file is too large a
compressed version with {\tt zip} but not {\tt gnuzip} nor {\tt
compress} is acceptable. However they prefer the uncompressed form if
possible. From my experience I do not recommend this method.

\subsection{Things to note}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure that there are the correct number of blank pages inserted
so that each double sided page has a front and a back.  So, for
example, the title page must be followed by an absolutely blank page
(not even a page number).

\item Submitted postscript introduces more potential problems.
Therefore you must either allow two iterations of the binding process
(once in a digital form, falling back to a second, paper, submission if
necessary) or submit both paper and electronic versions.

\item There may be unexpected problems with fonts.

\end{itemize}
